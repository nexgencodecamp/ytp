Follow these steps to help you write your program

1. Open the Arduino program
2. Select File > New
3. In the setup() function, initialise (which means 'setup') a digital pin as an output pin.
4. In the loop function set the same pin to high (write a high value to it)
5. Write a line of code that waits for half a second
6. Now set the pin to low
7. Now write some code that waits for one second
8. You are done!
9. Verify your code
10. Upload your code (Note if you don't have an Arduino this step will not be possible)
